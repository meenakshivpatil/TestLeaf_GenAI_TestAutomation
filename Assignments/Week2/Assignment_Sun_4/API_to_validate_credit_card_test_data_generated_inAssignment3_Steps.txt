1) Used CSV data generated from manually using chatGPT with prompt Engginering to generate test data from assignment 3.
2) Created request with prompt and test data and rules to validate (also took help from chatGPT to get below prompt and rules).
  changed it into single line and also escaped " so that API request parameter in postman is happy with entire line having no double quoates.
3) called API with request shown after this prompt

The following inconsistencies, missing information, or invalid values were found:\n\n### Credit Score Validation\n\n* All credit scores are within the valid range (500-850).\n\n### Income Validation\n\n* All incomes are valid, but some may not match the expected income range for certain employment statuses or credit card types.\n\n### Credit Card Type Validation\n\n* **Student Credit Card:** \n  + Ava Martinez (age 24) and Emily Jackson (age 22) are eligible for a Student Credit Card.\n  + Anna Johnson (age 25) is also eligible for a Student Credit Card.\n  However, **no applicants older than 30 have been issued a Student Credit Card**, so this rule is not violated.\n* **Business Credit Card:**\n  + Carlos Mendoza (self-employed) and David Harris (self-employed) are eligible for a Business Credit Card.\n  + **No business credit cards have been issued to applicants without self-employed or full-time employment status**, so this rule is not violated.\n\n### Employment Status Validation\n\n* **Retired persons:**\n  + Mary Roberts (age 55, retired, income $22,000) has a low income, which is valid.\n  + Isabella Clark (age 60, retired, income $40,000) has a moderate income, which is valid.\n  + Lily White (age 58, retired, income $30,000) has a low income, which is valid.\n  + **No retired persons have an income above $50,000**, so this rule is not violated.\n\n### Credit Score and Loan Amount Validation\n\n* **Fair credit score or lower (500-699) and loan amount:**\n  + Carlos Mendoza (credit score 650, loan amount $8,000) is valid.\n  + Emily Jackson (credit score 680, loan amount $3,000) is valid.\n  + Ava Martinez (credit score 660, loan amount $5,000) is valid.\n  + Grace Adams (credit score 690, loan amount $4,000) is valid.\n  + Noah Baker (credit score 640, loan amount $5,000) is valid.\n  + Mia Turner (credit score 690, loan amount $6,000) is **invalid**, as the loan amount exceeds $5,000 for a Fair credit score.\n  + **No other applicants with a Fair credit score or lower have requested a loan amount above $8,000**, so this rule is mostly not violated, except for Mia Turner.\n\nOther Observations\n-----------------\n\n* Some applicants have been rejected due to a high debt-to-income ratio (e.g., Carlos Mendoza) or low credit score (e.g., Noah Baker).\n* The dataset does not contain any missing information or obviously invalid values (e.g., negative incomes or credit scores).\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe dataset is mostly valid, with only one instance of an invalid loan amount for an applicant with a Fair credit score (Mia Turner). It is recommended to review Mia Turner's application and adjust the loan amount accordingly. Additionally, the credit card issuer may want to consider implementing more stringent rules or guidelines for approving credit card applications, especially for applicants with lower credit scores or higher loan amounts."
